# Open Graph Image Needed

## Required File
**Filename:** `og-image.jpg`  
**Location:** `public/og-image.jpg`  
**Dimensions:** 1200 x 630 pixels  
**Format:** JPG or PNG  
**File Size:** < 1MB (ideally < 300KB)

## Purpose
This image appears when someone shares a link to vifit.ca on:
- Facebook
- Twitter/X
- LinkedIn
- WhatsApp
- Slack
- Discord
- Other social platforms

## Design Recommendations
1. **Include Vi Fit branding** (logo, colors)
2. **Add text overlay** with key message:
   - "Vi, Your Neighbourhood Gym"
   - "Kelowna, BC"
   - "Limited Memberships • Beginner-Friendly"
3. **Use high-quality gym photo** (equipment, space, or people working out)
4. **Ensure text is readable** at small sizes (mobile previews)
5. **Keep important content in center** (edges may be cropped on some platforms)

## Safe Zone
Keep all important text and logos within the center 1200 x 600 area (avoid outer 15px on top/bottom).

## Temporary Solution
Until a custom og-image.jpg is created, you can use:
- `hero-kettle-bells.jpg` (already in public folder)
- `fulll-logo.png` (but needs to be converted to proper dimensions)

## How to Create
1. Use Canva (free): https://www.canva.com/create/open-graph/
2. Use Figma with 1200x630 frame
3. Hire a designer on Fiverr ($5-20)
4. Use an AI image generator with text overlay
