              It's okay to feel nervous about starting. Most of our members felt the same way before they walked through the doors.
              But staying stuck — putting it off, doubting yourself, waiting until you "feel ready" — that's what keeps you from
              becoming stronger, healthier, and more confident.

              At Vi, Your Neighbourhood Gym in Kelowna, we've built a space where beginners are guided, supported, and never judged.
              You don't have to have it all figured out. You just have to take the first step.
